Ideas:
1. Use text analysis/predict to analyse network traffic (captured using Wireshark) and detect possible cyber attack attempts in real time ( not sure if feasible, need    more research ;-; )

2. Against youth radicalisms/terrorism: 
   Sentiment Analysis: AWS Machine Learning can be used to analyze social media posts and identify potential threats. The machine learning algorithms can classify        posts   based on sentiment, identifying those that are potentially dangerous.
  
3. Analyse text messages / calls and state how likely it is to be a scam

4. Border control : check images on sea and causeway

5. Lazy Idea: covid cases predictor
